# Test Management with Jira
Manage test cases and bugs effectively with Jira.

To use JIRA for obtaining test metrics, you need to configure it effectively and integrate it with testing tools to gather data on test cases, defects, coverage, and quality. Here's a step-by-step guide to using JIRA for test metrics:

1. Configure JIRA to Manage Test Cases
While JIRA is primarily designed for project and issue tracking, you can configure it to handle test cases:

* Create Custom Issue Types:
    - Add a new issue type, such as "Test Case," to manage your test cases.

* Configure custom fields to include details like:
    - Success criteria.
    - Pre-conditions.
    - Expected results.

* Use Testing Plugins:
    - Integrate JIRA with tools like Zephyr, Xray, or TestFLO, which are specifically designed to manage test cases. These plugins allow you to create, execute, and link test cases directly to user stories or requirements.

2. Track Defects Accurately
JIRA is highly effective for tracking defects, and you can optimize its use for detailed metrics:

* Link Defects to Requirements or Test Cases:
    - Associate defects with backlog stories, epics, or test cases. This enables you to measure metrics like:
        - Defects by module.
        - Defects by functionality.
    - Use Custom Fields:  
        - Severity (Critical, Major, Minor).
        - Priority (High, Medium, Low).
        - Defect Type (Functional, UI, Performance).

3. Generate Metrics with JQL Filters
Use JQL (JIRA Query Language) to create queries that generate specific metrics.

Example Queries:

* Total Test Cases Created:
<issuetype = "Test Case">

*  Test Cases Executed in the Current Sprint:
issuetype = "Test Case" AND sprint = "Sprint 1" AND status IN ("Done", "In Progress")

* Defects by Severity:
issuetype = "Bug" AND severity = "Critical"

*  Defects Resolved in the Last Month:
issuetype = "Bug" AND status = "Resolved" AND resolved >= startOfMonth()

4. Use Dashboards and Gadgets
    - Create personalized dashboards to visualize metrics in real-time.

Steps:

Go to the "Dashboards" tab and click Create Dashboard.
Add gadgets to display key metrics, such as:
Issue Statistics: Displays the number of defects by severity or status.
Pie Chart: Shows the distribution of defect types or test cases.
Two-Dimensional Filter Statistics: Combines status and priority or module and severity.
Created vs. Resolved Chart: Compares defects created and resolved over time.
Example Gadget Configuration:

Filter: "Open Defects."
Chart: Pie chart showing defect distribution by severity.

5. Automate Test Reporting
Automate the generation and delivery of test reports to stakeholders.

Set Up Report Subscriptions:
Create JQL filters for the metrics you want to report.
Schedule automatic email delivery using JIRA's subscription feature.
Visual Reports:
Use graphs and charts from dashboard gadgets for sprint reviews.

6. Key Test Metrics in JIRA
Here are some test metrics you can track and how to retrieve them in JIRA:

Metric	How to Retrieve in JIRA
Test Coverage	Use plugins like Zephyr/Xray to track executed test cases.
Defects by Module	Link defects to epics or components in the backlog.
Defect Resolution Rate	JQL Filter: status = "Resolved".
Reopened Defects	JQL Filter: status = "Reopened".
Test Execution Rate	Zephyr/Xray: Execution metrics for test cases.

7. Integrate JIRA with Testing Tools
JIRA integrates with several tools to provide detailed test metrics:

Zephyr for JIRA:
Allows you to create, execute, and track test cases.
Reports include execution metrics and test results.
Xray for JIRA:
Offers a robust interface for managing tests and generating reports.
Metrics: test coverage, execution progress, and traceability.
Integration with Jenkins/Selenium:
Automatically log automated test results in JIRA.
Example: Configure Jenkins to report failed tests as defects in JIRA.
Practical Example
Scenario: You want to measure test coverage and defect resolution rates.
Step 1: JQL Filter

Test cases executed:
issuetype = "Test Case" AND status = "Executed"
Resolved defects:
issuetype = "Bug" AND status = "Resolved" AND resolved >= startOfWeek()
Step 2: Dashboard

Gadget: Pie Chart for defect severity distribution.
Gadget: Two-Dimensional Filter Statistics for execution progress by sprint.
By strategically using JIRA with filters, dashboards, and integrations, you can obtain clear and actionable test metrics to enhance software quality.
